# Geeks Out Buzzer

Geeks Out is a Geek Quiz in Dyuthi 2020. This is a buzzer application in Flutter for the final round. It consists of two apps.

1. **Buzzer App**: Given out to the participants.
2. **Reset App**: Available with the organizer.

Everything is synced with the Firebase. Each button press triggers an alarm and sends a timestamp and username to the Firebase databasae. The same is updated in the organizer's app.
